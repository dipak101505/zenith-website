                <h2>1. Oscillations and Periodic Motion</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Oscillations are repetitive motions that occur in a fixed period. The time period (T) is the time taken to complete one full cycle of the oscillation, and the frequency (f) is the number of oscillations per unit time.</li>
                  <li>Displacement as a function of time for periodic motion can be described using periodic functions like sine and cosine.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Simple Harmonic Motion (S.H.M.) and Its Equation</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Simple Harmonic Motion (S.H.M.) is a type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the opposite direction.</li>
                  <li>The equation for S.H.M. is: 
                    <pre>F = -kx</pre>
                    where F is the restoring force, k is the force constant, and x is the displacement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Phase in Oscillations</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The phase of oscillation defines the position of the object in its cycle of motion at any given point in time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Oscillations of a Spring: Restoring Force and Force Constant</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The restoring force for a spring is given by Hooke’s law:
                    <pre>F = -kx</pre>
                    where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Energy in S.H.M.: Kinetic and Potential Energies</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>In Simple Harmonic Motion, energy oscillates between kinetic and potential forms.</li>
                  <li>The total mechanical energy (E) is constant:
                    <pre>E = (1/2)kA²</pre>
                    where A is the amplitude of oscillation.</li>
                  <li>The kinetic energy (K.E.) is maximum at the equilibrium position, and the potential energy (P.E.) is maximum at the extremes of the motion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Simple Pendulum: Derivation of Expression for Its Time Period</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The time period (T) of a simple pendulum is derived as:
                    <pre>T = 2π√(L/g)</pre>
                    where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Wave Motion</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Wave motion refers to the propagation of disturbances through a medium. Waves can be classified as longitudinal or transverse.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Longitudinal and Transverse Waves</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Longitudinal waves:</strong> In longitudinal waves, the displacement of particles is parallel to the direction of wave propagation (e.g., sound waves).</li>
                  <li><strong>Transverse waves:</strong> In transverse waves, the displacement of particles is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation (e.g., waves on a string).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Speed of the Travelling Wave</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The speed of a wave (v) is given by the relation:
                    <pre>v = fλ</pre>
                    where f is the frequency and λ is the wavelength of the wave.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>10. Displacement Relation for a Progressive Wave</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The displacement for a progressive wave can be represented as:
                    <pre>y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ)</pre>
                    where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase constant.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>11. Principle of Superposition of Waves</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement at any point is the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>12. Reflection of Waves</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>When waves encounter a boundary, they may reflect back. The reflection of waves follows specific rules, including the inversion of transverse waves.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>13. Standing Waves in Strings and Organ Pipes</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Standing waves are formed when two waves of the same frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions interfere with each other.</li>
                  <li>In a string fixed at both ends, standing waves form at specific frequencies called harmonics.</li>
                  <li>In organ pipes, standing waves form inside the pipe, with the frequency depending on the pipe’s length and whether it is closed or open at the ends.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>14. Fundamental Mode and Harmonics</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The fundamental mode is the lowest frequency at which a system oscillates. Harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>15. Beats</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Beats occur when two waves of slightly different frequencies interfere with each other, creating a variation in amplitude over time.</li>
                  <li>The beat frequency is given by:
                    <pre>f_beat = |f₁ - f₂|</pre>
                    where f₁ and f₂ are the frequencies of the two waves.</li>
                </ul>
