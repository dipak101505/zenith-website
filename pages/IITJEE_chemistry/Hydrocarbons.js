                <h2>1. Classification of Hydrocarbons</h2>
                <p>
                  Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that consist solely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. They are classified into:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Alkanes (Saturated hydrocarbons):</strong> Compounds with only single bonds between carbon atoms (e.g., methane, ethane).</li>
                  <li><strong>Alkenes (Unsaturated hydrocarbons):</strong> Compounds with at least one double bond between carbon atoms (e.g., ethene, propene).</li>
                  <li><strong>Alkynes (Unsaturated hydrocarbons):</strong> Compounds with at least one triple bond between carbon atoms (e.g., ethyne, propyne).</li>
                  <li><strong>Aromatic hydrocarbons:</strong> Compounds that contain a benzene ring as a part of their structure (e.g., benzene, toluene).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Isomerism in Hydrocarbons</h2>
                <p>
                  Hydrocarbons exhibit different types of isomerism, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Structural Isomerism:</strong> Same molecular formula but different structural arrangements (e.g., butane and isobutane).</li>
                  <li><strong>Geometrical Isomerism:</strong> Occurs in alkenes due to the restricted rotation around the double bond (e.g., cis and trans forms).</li>
                  <li><strong>Optical Isomerism:</strong> Occurs when there is a chiral center in the molecule, as seen in some alkynes and substituted benzene compounds.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. IUPAC Nomenclature of Hydrocarbons</h2>
                <p>
                  Hydrocarbons are named according to IUPAC rules. For alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, the name is derived from the longest chain of carbon atoms, followed by the appropriate suffix (-ane for alkanes, -ene for alkenes, -yne for alkynes). Substituents are named based on their position in the chain.
                </p>

                <h2>4. General Methods of Preparation of Hydrocarbons</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Alkanes:</strong> Alkanes are typically prepared by the reduction of alkenes or alkynes, or by the Wurtz reaction.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alkenes:</strong> Alkenes are prepared by elimination reactions such as dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides or dehydration of alcohols.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alkynes:</strong> Alkynes are prepared by the dehydrohalogenation of dihalides or by the reaction of alkynyl compounds with alkyl halides.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aromatic Hydrocarbons:</strong> Aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene are prepared by catalytic reforming or from coal tar.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Properties and Reactions of Hydrocarbons</h2>
                <p>
                  Hydrocarbons undergo various types of reactions:
                </p>

                <h3>Alkanes</h3>
                <p>
                  Alkanes are relatively unreactive but can undergo reactions such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Halogenation:</strong> The reaction of alkanes with halogens in the presence of heat or light, resulting in alkyl halides.</li>
                  <li><strong>Conformations:</strong> The study of the different spatial arrangements of atoms in a molecule due to rotation about single bonds, such as in ethane. These can be visualized using Sawhorse and Newman projections.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Alkenes</h3>
                <p>
                  Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the presence of a double bond and can undergo:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Electrophilic Addition:</strong> Addition of halogens, hydrogen halides, and water across the double bond.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hydrogenation:</strong> The addition of hydrogen to alkenes in the presence of a catalyst, resulting in alkanes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Markovnikov’s Rule:</strong> When hydrogen halides are added to alkenes, the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon with the greater number of hydrogen atoms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Peroxide Effect:</strong> Addition of hydrogen halides in the presence of peroxides gives anti-Markovnikov products.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ozonolysis:</strong> The cleavage of alkenes with ozone, producing aldehydes or ketones.</li>
                  <li><strong>Polymerization:</strong> The process where alkenes undergo chain growth to form polymers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Alkynes</h3>
                <p>
                  Alkynes also undergo reactions similar to alkenes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Acidic Character:</strong> Alkynes exhibit acidic behavior due to the sp hybridization of carbon, making the hydrogen attached to the triple bond relatively acidic.</li>
                  <li><strong>Addition of Hydrogen:</strong> Alkynes can undergo hydrogenation to form alkanes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Halogenation:</strong> Addition of halogens to alkynes forms tetrahalides.</li>
                  <li><strong>Addition of Water:</strong> Alkynes undergo hydration to form carbonyl compounds (ketones or aldehydes).</li>
                  <li><strong>Polymerization:</strong> Alkynes can undergo polymerization to form larger carbon-based compounds.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Aromatic Hydrocarbons</h3>
                <p>
                  Aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene have unique reactions due to their resonance and aromaticity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Electrophilic Substitution:</strong> The primary reaction mechanism of aromatic hydrocarbons, including halogenation, nitration, and sulfonation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Friedel-Crafts Alkylation and Acylation:</strong> Reactions in which an alkyl or acyl group is introduced into the benzene ring using a catalyst like AlCl₃.</li>
                  <li><strong>Directive Influence:</strong> Substituents on the benzene ring influence the positions of incoming groups. Electron-donating groups activate the ring at the ortho- and para-positions, while electron-withdrawing groups activate it at the meta-position.</li>
                </ul>
