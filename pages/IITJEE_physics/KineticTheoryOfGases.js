                <h2>1. Equation of State of a Perfect Gas</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The equation of state for a perfect gas is given by the ideal gas law:
                    <pre>PV = nRT</pre>
                    where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Work Done on Compressing a Gas</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Work done (W) on compressing a gas is given by:
                    <pre>W = ∫ P dV</pre>
                    where P is the pressure and V is the volume of the gas.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Kinetic Theory of Gases: Assumptions</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The gas consists of a large number of molecules in random motion.</li>
                  <li>The volume of the gas molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container.</li>
                  <li>The molecules do not experience any intermolecular forces except during collisions.</li>
                  <li>Collisions of gas molecules are perfectly elastic (no energy is lost in collisions).</li>
                  <li>The time spent during collisions is negligible compared to the time between collisions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Concept of Pressure</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pressure (P) exerted by a gas is the force per unit area on the walls of its container, caused by the continuous collisions of the gas molecules with the walls.
                    <pre>P = (1/3) * (n * m * v^2)</pre>
                    where n is the number of molecules, m is the mass of a molecule, and v is the velocity of the molecules.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Kinetic Interpretation of Temperature</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules:
                    <pre>K.E. = (3/2) kT</pre>
                    where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. RMS Speed of Gas Molecules</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The root mean square (RMS) speed of gas molecules is the square root of the average of the squares of the velocities of the molecules.
                    <pre>v_{rms} = √((3kT) / m)</pre>
                    where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and m is the mass of the molecule.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Degrees of Freedom</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent ways in which a molecule can store energy. For a monatomic gas, there are 3 degrees of freedom (translational motion in x, y, and z directions). For a diatomic gas, there are 5 degrees of freedom (3 translational and 2 rotational).
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Law of Equipartition of Energy</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The law of equipartition of energy states that energy is equally distributed among all degrees of freedom. Each degree of freedom contributes an energy of (1/2)kT to the system.
                    <pre>E = (f/2) kT</pre>
                    where f is the number of degrees of freedom.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Applications to Specific Heat Capacities of Gases</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Specific heat capacity is related to the degrees of freedom of the molecules. For a monoatomic ideal gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume is (3/2)R, and for a diatomic ideal gas, it is (5/2)R at constant volume.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>10. Mean Free Path</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. It is given by:
                    <pre>λ = 1 / (√2 * nσ)</pre>
                    where n is the number of molecules per unit volume, and σ is the effective collision cross-section.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>11. Avogadro&apos;s Number</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Avogadro&apos;s number (Nₐ) is the number of molecules in one mole of a substance, approximately 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol.</li>
                </ul>
