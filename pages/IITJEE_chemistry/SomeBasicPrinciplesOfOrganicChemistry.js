                <h2>1. Tetravalency of Carbon</h2>
                <p>
                  Carbon is tetravalent, meaning it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms. This property enables carbon to form a wide variety of compounds, including chains, rings, and networks. The tetravalency of carbon is fundamental to the structure of organic compounds.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Shapes of Simple Molecules - Hybridization</h2>
                <p>
                  Hybridization is the process in which atomic orbitals combine to form new hybrid orbitals. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>sp3 Hybridization:</strong> Seen in methane (CH₄), resulting in a tetrahedral geometry.</li>
                  <li><strong>sp2 Hybridization:</strong> Seen in ethene (C₂H₄), resulting in a trigonal planar geometry.</li>
                  <li><strong>sp Hybridization:</strong> Seen in ethyne (C₂H₂), resulting in a linear geometry.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Classification of Organic Compounds</h2>
                <p>
                  Organic compounds can be classified based on the functional groups present and their atoms of attachment. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Halogens</strong>: Compounds containing halogen atoms like chlorine or bromine (e.g., alkyl halides).</li>
                  <li><strong>Oxygen</strong>: Alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and acids are all oxygen-containing compounds.</li>
                  <li><strong>Nitrogen</strong>: Compounds containing nitrogen include amines, amides, and nitriles.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sulfur</strong>: Sulfur-containing compounds include thiols and sulfides.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Homologous Series</h2>
                <p>
                  A homologous series is a group of organic compounds with the same functional group and similar chemical properties but differing by a constant unit (such as a CH₂ group). For example, alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes are all homologous series.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Isomerism</h2>
                <p>
                  Isomerism occurs when two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but different structures or spatial arrangements. Types of isomerism include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Structural Isomerism:</strong> Occurs due to different connectivity of atoms (e.g., butane and isobutane).</li>
                  <li><strong>Stereoisomerism:</strong> Occurs due to different spatial arrangement of atoms (e.g., cis-trans isomerism in alkenes).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Nomenclature of Organic Compounds</h2>
                <p>
                  Organic compounds can be named using two systems:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Trivial Nomenclature:</strong> Common names like ethanol, acetic acid, etc.</li>
                  <li><strong>IUPAC Nomenclature:</strong> Systematic naming based on the structure of the compound, such as methanol (CH₃OH) or ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Covalent Bond Fission</h2>
                <p>
                  When a covalent bond breaks, the resulting fragments can carry either a positive or negative charge. This can occur in two ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Homolytic Fission:</strong> Each fragment gets one electron, forming free radicals.</li>
                  <li><strong>Heterolytic Fission:</strong> One fragment takes both electrons, forming ions like carbocations or carbanions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Stability of Carbocations, Carbanions, and Free Radicals</h2>
                <p>
                  The stability of these intermediates is crucial for the understanding of organic reactions. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Carbocations</strong>: Stable when alkyl groups or electron-donating groups are attached (e.g., tertiary carbocations are more stable than primary carbocations).</li>
                  <li><strong>Carbanions</strong>: Stable when electron-withdrawing groups are present (e.g., fluorine or nitro groups).</li>
                  <li><strong>Free Radicals</strong>: Stability increases with the number of alkyl groups attached to the radical center.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Electrophiles and Nucleophiles</h2>
                <p>
                  Electrophiles are electron-deficient species that seek to accept electrons, while nucleophiles are electron-rich species that seek to donate electrons. Both play key roles in organic reactions.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Electronic Displacement in a Covalent Bond</h2>
                <p>
                  The displacement of electrons in a covalent bond can be explained by various effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Inductive Effect:</strong> The shifting of electron density through sigma bonds, usually due to electronegativity differences.</li>
                  <li><strong>Electromeric Effect:</strong> The shift of electrons in a double bond under the influence of an attacking reagent.</li>
                  <li><strong>Resonance:</strong> The delocalization of electrons across adjacent atoms, as seen in the benzene ring.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hyperconjugation:</strong> The delocalization of electrons from adjacent C-H or C-C bonds to an empty p-orbital or π-orbital.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>11. Types of Organic Reactions</h2>
                <p>
                  Organic reactions can be classified into several major types, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Substitution Reactions:</strong> A functional group is replaced by another (e.g., halogenation of alkanes).</li>
                  <li><strong>Addition Reactions:</strong> Two reactants add together to form a new product (e.g., hydrogenation of alkenes).</li>
                  <li><strong>Elimination Reactions:</strong> A small molecule is eliminated from the reactant (e.g., dehydration of alcohols to form alkenes).</li>
                  <li><strong>Rearrangement Reactions:</strong> Atoms or groups within a molecule rearrange to form an isomer (e.g., Beckmann rearrangement).</li>
                </ul>
