                <p>The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) is a highly competitive examination that paves the way for aspiring medical and dental students to secure seats in prestigious colleges across India. Once the exam is over, the answer scripts are evaluated by NTA officials based on standard protocols. To find out the result of NEET 2025, you will have to check out NEETs official website.</p>

                <h1 className="pb-2">NEET 2025 Participating Institutions, Reservation, and Seats Availability</h1>

                <p>Once the NEET results are declared, every candidate is given an All India Rank (AIR). The counselling process then begins, in which medical and dental undergraduate seats are allotted to candidates based on merit and their choice. The Medical Council of India conducts NEET counselling for 15% of central institutes, state seats, and deemed universities. Respective state medical boards do the counselling for the rest 85% of the seats. In addition, each state prepares its merit list based on NEET-UG results itself.</p>

                <h1 className="pb-2">NEET 2025 Cut-off</h1>

                <p>To qualify for NEET 2025, you need to achieve a minimum score, also known as the cut-off score. This score is specified by the NTA and announced on the official NEET website. The NEET 2025 results are typically published on the official NEET website, and candidates can access them by entering their roll number and other required details. Keep a close eye on the official NEET website and stay updated on the announcement of the result date. The NEET 2025 cut-off scores will be released alongside the NEET 2025 results. Cut-offs differ from category to category. The merit list for counselling and admission procedure is based on this score.</p>

                <p>Two main factors decide the NEET cut-off score for a particular year:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of candidates appearing for the exam</li>
                    <li>The difficulty level of the exam</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 className="pb-2">NEET 2025 Answer Key</h1>

                <p>Not all sets of NEET 2025 question papers are expected to be the same. NEET question papers are coded, and once the exam is over, the NTA releases the answer key to all the sets of question papers. NEET Answer Keys are usually released around one week after the exam. The OMR response sheets of all the candidates who appeared in the exam are also uploaded so that there is transparency in the evaluation process. If you find any discrepancy when you verify your responses against the NEET answer key by NTA, you can challenge it for a fee of Rs. 1000 per challenge. You get a few days to file your challenges.</p>
