                <h2>1. General Methods of Preparation of Organic Halides</h2>
                <p>
                  Organic compounds containing halogens (organic halides) can be prepared through various methods, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>From Alkanes:</strong> By halogenation (e.g., chlorination or bromination) of alkanes in the presence of heat or light.</li>
                  <li><strong>From Alcohols:</strong> By reaction with halogenating agents like PCl₃, SOCl₂, or HX.</li>
                  <li><strong>From Aromatic Compounds:</strong> By electrophilic substitution with halogens (e.g., chlorination or bromination) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl₃.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Properties of Organic Halides</h2>
                <p>
                  Organic halides exhibit specific chemical and physical properties based on the halogen and the structure of the molecule:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Physical Properties:</strong> Organic halides tend to have higher boiling points compared to their non-halogenated counterparts due to the electronegativity of the halogen atoms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Chemical Properties:</strong> They are often reactive in substitution and elimination reactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Reactions of Organic Halides</h2>
                <p>
                  Organic halides undergo a variety of reactions, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Substitution Reactions:</strong> Involves the replacement of the halogen atom with another group or atom. Examples include nucleophilic substitution (SN1 and SN2) and electrophilic substitution in aromatic compounds.</li>
                  <li><strong>Elimination Reactions:</strong> Involves the loss of a halogen atom and a hydrogen atom from adjacent carbon atoms, leading to the formation of alkenes (e.g., dehydrohalogenation).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Nature of the C-X Bond</h2>
                <p>
                  The bond between carbon and halogen (C-X) in organic halides is polar due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon and halogen. This polarity plays a crucial role in the reactivity of organic halides, making them prone to substitution and elimination reactions. The strength of the C-X bond decreases as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>C-I</strong> <em>(weakest)</em></li>
                  <li><strong>C-Br</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>C-Cl</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>C-F</strong> <em>(strongest)</em></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Mechanisms of Substitution Reactions</h2>
                <p>
                  Substitution reactions in organic halides can proceed via two major mechanisms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>SN1 Mechanism:</strong> A two-step process involving the formation of a carbocation intermediate. It is favored by polar solvents and tertiary halides.</li>
                  <li><strong>SN2 Mechanism:</strong> A single-step process where the nucleophile attacks the carbon atom from the opposite side of the halogen, leading to a concerted displacement of the halogen. It is favored by primary halides and polar aprotic solvents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Uses of Organic Halides</h2>
                <p>
                  Organic halides have diverse applications in various industries:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Chloroform (CHCl₃):</strong> Used as an anesthetic (historically), solvent, and in the production of Freons.</li>
                  <li><strong>Iodoform (CHI₃):</strong> Used as a disinfectant and antiseptic.</li>
                  <li><strong>Freons:</strong> Used as refrigerants and propellants in aerosol cans (though they are now banned due to their contribution to ozone depletion).</li>
                  <li><strong>DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane):</strong> An insecticide used extensively in the past (now banned in many countries due to environmental and health concerns).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Environmental Effects of Organic Halides</h2>
                <p>
                  The environmental impact of some organic halides can be significant:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Chloroform:</strong> Exposure to chloroform can be harmful to the liver and kidneys, and it is also a suspected carcinogen.</li>
                  <li><strong>Iodoform:</strong> While generally safe in small amounts, it can cause irritation to the skin and eyes and is toxic in large quantities.</li>
                  <li><strong>Freons:</strong> The release of Freons into the atmosphere contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer.</li>
                  <li><strong>DDT:</strong> DDT is highly persistent in the environment and accumulates in the food chain, leading to long-term ecological damage.</li>
                </ul>
