                <h1>Electronic Devices â€“ JEE Mains Physics</h1>

                <h2>1. Semiconductors</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Semiconductors are materials that have conductivity between conductors and insulators. The conductivity of semiconductors can be increased by doping, introducing impurities into the material.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Semiconductor Diode: I-V Characteristics in Forward and Reverse Bias</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>A semiconductor diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction only. In forward bias, the diode conducts current after a threshold voltage is reached. In reverse bias, the current is negligible until the breakdown voltage is exceeded.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Diode as a Rectifier</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Diodes are widely used as rectifiers, converting alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). In a half-wave rectifier, the diode allows current to pass during only one half of the AC cycle, while a full-wave rectifier uses two diodes to conduct during both halves of the cycle.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. I-V Characteristics of LED</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The LED (Light Emitting Diode) exhibits the property of emitting light when current passes through it. The I-V characteristics show that the diode has a forward voltage, and its emission intensity increases with the forward current.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. The Photodiode</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>A photodiode is a diode that generates a photocurrent when illuminated by light. It works in reverse bias, and the current produced depends on the intensity of the light incident on the diode.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Solar Cell</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>A solar cell is a device that converts light energy directly into electrical energy using the photovoltaic effect. It is essentially a photodiode optimized for energy generation from sunlight.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Zener Diode and Zener Diode as Voltage Regulator</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The Zener diode is a special-purpose diode designed to allow current to flow in the reverse direction when the voltage exceeds a certain value (Zener breakdown). It is commonly used as a voltage regulator to maintain a constant voltage level in circuits.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Logic Gates (OR, AND, NOT, NAND, NOR)</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. The most common logic gates include:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>OR Gate</b>: Outputs 1 if at least one input is 1.</li>
                    <li><b>AND Gate</b>: Outputs 1 if both inputs are 1.</li>
                    <li><b>NOT Gate</b>: Outputs the opposite of the input (inverts the input).</li>
                    <li><b>NAND Gate</b>: Outputs 0 only when both inputs are 1.</li>
                    <li><b>NOR Gate</b>: Outputs 0 if at least one input is 1.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
