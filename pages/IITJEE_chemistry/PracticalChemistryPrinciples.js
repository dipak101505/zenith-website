                <h2>1. Detection of Extra Elements in Organic Compounds</h2>
                <p>
                  In practical chemistry, the detection of extra elements like nitrogen, sulfur, and halogens in organic compounds is a fundamental task. Various methods such as the Lassaigne’s test are used for this purpose.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Nitrogen Detection:</strong> The presence of nitrogen is confirmed by heating the organic compound with sodium metal, forming sodium cyanide, which can be identified by its reaction with ferric chloride.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sulfur Detection:</strong> Sulfur is detected by the formation of a yellow precipitate when sodium fusion extract is treated with lead acetate.</li>
                  <li><strong>Halogen Detection:</strong> Halogens are identified through reactions with silver nitrate to form precipitates like silver chloride, silver bromide, or silver iodide.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Detection of Functional Groups in Organic Compounds</h2>
                <p>
                  The detection of functional groups like hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, and amino groups is vital in organic chemistry.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Hydroxyl Group:</strong> The presence of alcohols or phenols can be confirmed using Lucas reagent or phenolphthalein in neutral conditions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Carbonyl Group:</strong> Aldehydes and ketones can be detected by reactions such as the Tollen’s test or Fehling’s test.</li>
                  <li><strong>Carboxyl Group:</strong> Carboxylic acids are detected by their reaction with sodium bicarbonate to release carbon dioxide.</li>
                  <li><strong>Amino Group:</strong> Amines are detected through reactions like the ninhydrin test, where they form a blue or purple color.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Chemistry Involved in the Preparation of Organic and Inorganic Compounds</h2>
                <p>
                  Practical chemistry often involves the preparation of various compounds. Below are some key examples.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Inorganic Compounds:</strong> Mohr’s salt and potash alum are prepared by specific reactions involving salts and acids.</li>
                  <li><strong>Organic Compounds:</strong> Acetanilide, p-nitro acetanilide, aniline yellow, and iodoform are synthesized using reactions like nitration, condensation, and halogenation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Titrimetric Exercises and Indicators</h2>
                <p>
                  Titrimetric exercises are a cornerstone in practical chemistry, particularly in acid-base titrations and redox reactions.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Acids and Bases:</strong> The titration of acids and bases is performed using indicators like phenolphthalein for strong acid-strong base titrations.</li>
                  <li><strong>Oxalic Acid vs KMnO₄:</strong> Oxalic acid is titrated against potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) to determine its concentration.</li>
                  <li><strong>Mohr’s Salt vs KMnO₄:</strong> Mohr’s salt is used in redox titrations with KMnO₄ to study oxidation-reduction reactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Qualitative Salt Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                  Qualitative salt analysis is a practical technique used to identify cations and anions in a given salt sample. Below are the major ions studied in this analysis.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Cations:</strong> Pb²⁺, Cu²⁺, Al³⁺, Fe³⁺, Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Ca²⁺, Ba²⁺, Mg²⁺, NH₄⁺</li>
                  <li><strong>Anions:</strong> CO₃²⁻, S²⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻, Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻ (Insoluble salts excluded)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Chemical Principles in Experimental Studies</h2>
                <p>
                  Several experiments in practical chemistry help understand thermodynamics, kinetics, and other principles.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Enthalpy of Solution of CuSO₄:</strong> The enthalpy change when copper sulfate dissolves in water can be measured to understand the heat involved in the process.</li>
                  <li><strong>Enthalpy of Neutralization:</strong> The enthalpy change during the neutralization of a strong acid with a strong base can be measured to study the energy change in acid-base reactions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Preparation of Lyophilic and Lyophobic Sols:</strong> The preparation of sols involves dispersion of solid particles in liquids, with lyophilic sols being more stable than lyophobic sols.</li>
