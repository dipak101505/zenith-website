                <h2>1. Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation involving a function and its derivatives with respect to one independent variable.</li>
                  <li>It represents the relationship between a function and its rate of change.</li>
                  <li>In general, the form of an ODE is: f(x, y, y&apos;, y&apos;&apos;, ...) = 0, where y is the dependent variable, and x is the independent variable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Order and Degree of Differential Equations</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The **order** of a differential equation is the highest derivative present in the equation.</li>
                  <li>The **degree** is the power of the highest derivative when the equation is polynomial in derivatives (i.e., no fractional or negative powers of derivatives).</li>
                  <li>Example: For the equation (d²y/dx²) + 2(dy/dx) = 0, the order is 2, and the degree is 1.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Solution of Differential Equations</h2>
                <h3>3.1. Solution by the Method of Separation of Variables</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Separation of variables is a method to solve ODEs of the form: f(y)dy = g(x)dx.</li>
                  <li>Steps for solving:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Rearrange the equation to separate variables (y terms on one side and x terms on the other side).</li>
                      <li>Integrate both sides of the equation.</li>
                      <li>Find the constant of integration using initial conditions (if given).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Example: Solve the equation (dy/dx) = y/x, which can be rewritten as (1/y)dy = (1/x)dx, and integrate both sides.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2. Solution of Homogeneous Differential Equations</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>A homogeneous differential equation is one in which the ratio of the dependent and independent variables remains constant.</li>
                  <li>The general form of a homogeneous first-order differential equation is:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>(dy/dx) = f(y/x)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>To solve, use substitution: let y = vx, where v = y/x.</li>
                  <li>Then, the equation becomes separable, and the solution can be found by integration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3. Solution of Linear Differential Equations</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>A linear first-order differential equation has the form:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>(dy/dx) + P(x)y = Q(x)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>To solve, find the integrating factor, I(x), which is given by:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I(x) = e^(∫P(x) dx)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Multiply the entire equation by I(x) to make the left-hand side an exact derivative. Then, integrate both sides to find y.</li>
                  <li>Example: Solve (dy/dx) + y = e^x. The integrating factor is e^x, and multiplying the equation by e^x gives the solution.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. General Solution of a Differential Equation</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The general solution of a differential equation contains arbitrary constants, determined by initial conditions or boundary conditions.</li>
                  <li>For example, the general solution of (dy/dx) = y/x is y = Cx, where C is the constant of integration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Special Types of Differential Equations</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Exact Differential Equations:</strong> An equation of the form M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0 is exact if ∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x. In such cases, we can find the potential function by integrating M(x, y) with respect to x and N(x, y) with respect to y.</li>
                  <li><strong>Bernoulli&apos;s Differential Equation:</strong>  A non-linear differential equation of the form (dy/dx) + P(x)y = Q(x)y^n. This can be transformed into a linear equation by using the substitution z = y^(1-n).</li>
                </ul>
