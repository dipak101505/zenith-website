                <h2>1. General Introduction to d-Block and f-Block Elements</h2>
                <p>
                  The d-block and f-block elements are transition and inner transition elements, respectively. The d-block elements are located in groups 3 to 12 of the periodic table, while the f-block elements, also known as inner transition elements, are found in the lanthanoid and actinoid series.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Electronic Configuration of Transition Elements</h2>
                <p>
                  Transition elements have partially filled d-orbitals. The general electronic configuration of transition elements is (n-1)d¹–¹⁰ ns¹–². These elements exhibit a wide variety of oxidation states due to the availability of d-electrons for bonding.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Properties of d-Block (Transition) Elements</h2>
                <p>
                  Transition elements exhibit unique properties due to the presence of d-electrons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Physical Properties:</strong> These elements have high melting and boiling points, high density, and good electrical and thermal conductivity.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ionization Enthalpy:</strong> Transition metals have relatively high ionization enthalpy, though it does not increase significantly across the period.</li>
                  <li><strong>Oxidation States:</strong> Transition elements show a wide range of oxidation states, typically from +1 to +7, due to the involvement of both s and d electrons in bonding.</li>
                  <li><strong>Atomic Radii:</strong> The atomic radii of transition elements do not decrease significantly across a period due to the poor shielding of nuclear charge by d-electrons.</li>
                  <li><strong>Colour:</strong> Many transition metal compounds are colored due to d-d transitions when electrons absorb light and move between d-orbitals.</li>
                  <li><strong>Catalytic Behaviour:</strong> Transition metals act as catalysts in a variety of chemical reactions due to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and facilitate electron transfer.</li>
                  <li><strong>Magnetic Properties:</strong> Transition metals can exhibit magnetic properties due to unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals, which contribute to their paramagnetism.</li>
                  <li><strong>Complex Formation:</strong> Transition metals readily form coordination compounds due to their ability to accept electron pairs from ligands.</li>
                  <li><strong>Interstitial Compounds:</strong> Transition elements form interstitial compounds with small atoms like hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen filling the interstitial spaces in the metal lattice.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alloy Formation:</strong> Transition metals are widely used to form alloys, such as steel, due to their malleability and resistance to corrosion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Preparation, Properties, and Uses of K₂Cr₂O₇ and KMnO₄</h2>
                <p>
                  Potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) and potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) are important compounds of transition elements with a wide range of industrial applications:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>K₂Cr₂O₇:</strong> Prepared by reacting chromium ore with potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate. It is used in electroplating, as a disinfectant, and in organic synthesis.</li>
                  <li><strong>KMnO₄:</strong> Prepared by oxidizing manganese dioxide with potassium hydroxide. It is used as an oxidizing agent in titrations, water treatment, and as a disinfectant.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Inner Transition Elements</h2>
                <p>
                  The inner transition elements are the lanthanoids and actinoids. They are placed in two rows below the main body of the periodic table to maintain its structure.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Lanthanoids</h2>
                <p>
                  Lanthanoids are elements in the 4f block, ranging from lanthanum (La) to lutetium (Lu). They have similar chemical properties and exhibit a gradual contraction in atomic and ionic radii, known as the lanthanoid contraction.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Electronic Configuration:</strong> Lanthanoids have the general electronic configuration of (n-2)f¹–¹⁴ ns².</li>
                  <li><strong>Oxidation States:</strong> The most common oxidation state of lanthanoids is +3, but they can also show oxidation states of +2 and +4 in some cases.</li>
                  <li><strong>Lanthanoid Contraction:</strong> Due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the f-electrons, the size of lanthanoids decreases as you move across the series.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Actinoids</h2>
                <p>
                  Actinoids are elements in the 5f block, ranging from actinium (Ac) to lawrencium (Lr). Many actinoids are radioactive and exhibit a variety of oxidation states.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Electronic Configuration:</strong> Actinoids have the general electronic configuration of (n-2)f¹–¹⁴ ns².</li>
                  <li><strong>Oxidation States:</strong> Actinoids exhibit a wide range of oxidation states, typically from +3 to +7, with the +3 oxidation state being the most common.</li>
                </ul>
